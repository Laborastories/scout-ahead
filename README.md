## Champion Image Storage

The app can store champion images (icons and splash art) in an S3 bucket for better performance and reliability. To set this up:

1. Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account
2. Set up the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_REGION=your-region # e.g. us-east-1
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   AWS_BUCKET_URL=https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com # or your CloudFront URL
   ```

3. The app will automatically:
   - Download champion images from DDragon
   - Convert them to WebP format for better performance
   - Upload them to your S3 bucket
   - Use the S3 URLs in the UI

If S3 is not configured, the app will fall back to using DDragon and Community Dragon URLs directly.
